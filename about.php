      Ma and Pa Kettle have been providing quality arts and crafts supplies to the community for 25 years.
      As the parents of nine children and thirteen grandchildren, the memories that they have shared doing
      craft activities with the family are priceless. The Kettle’s know the importance of buying quality
      crafts at a good price. They stock name brand supplies and set their prices at or below the competition.
      The store is designed to give the customer a comfortable “at home” feel. The in-store lounge is open
      during store hours so members of the community can come together to enjoy coffee and share their love
      of arts and crafts. Themed craft nights are scheduled during the week as well and someone is on site
      during this time to help beginners. Come be a part of the craft family!
